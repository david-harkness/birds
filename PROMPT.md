At dataPlor we write software that deals with exponentially expanding data. We are looking for people who can solve novel problems by demonstrating first principles of design and performance that flow from deep understanding and integrating them into best practices of code quality and organization.

This code challenge is designed to test your decision making without writing a lot of code or taking a ton of time. That said, we do value clean, well-organized code.

There's no set deadline. Take as much time as you need and let us know when to expect it. 

Our objective is to assess how you think about, approach, and solve novel problems. Feel free to include a README that explains your thinking, solutions you considered but didn't implement, or anything else you feel might not come through in the code.

## The ask
We have an adjacency list that creates a tree of nodes where a child's `parent_id` = a parent's `id`. We have provided some sample data in the attached csv.

Please make an API using PostgreSQL and Ruby (rails, sinatra, cuba - your choice) that has two endpoints:

### 1. Common Ancestor 
`/nodes/:node_a_id/common_ancestors/:node_b_id` - It should return the `root_id`, `lowest_common_ancestor_id`, 
and `depth` of tree of the lowest common ancestor that those two node ids share.

For example, given the data for nodes:
```
   id    | parent_id
---------+-----------
     125 |       130
     130 |          
 2820230 |       125
 4430546 |       125
 5497637 |   4430546
```
      130              1
      125              2
2820230 4430546        3
        5497637        4




`/nodes/5497637/common_ancestors/2820230` should return
`{root_id: 130, lowest_common_ancestor: 125, depth: 2}`

`/nodes/5497637/common_ancestors/130` should return
`{root_id: 130, lowest_common_ancestor: 130, depth: 1}`

`/nodes/5497637/common_ancestors/4430546` should return
`{root_id: 130, lowest_common_ancestor: 4430546, depth: 3}`

if there is no common node match, return null for all fields

`/nodes/9/common_ancestors/4430546` should return
`{root_id: null, lowest_common_ancestor: null, depth: null}`

if a==b, it should return itself

`/nodes/4430546/common_ancestors/4430546` should return
`{root_id: 130, lowest_common_ancestor: 4430546, depth: 3}`

### 2. Birds

Another endpoint `/birds` - The second requirement for this project involves considering a second model, birds. Nodes have_many birds and birds belong_to nodes. Our second endpoint should take a list of `node_ids` and return the ids of the birds that belong to any of those nodes or any descendant nodes.

## Submission

Please fork this repository and provide a link to your fork. Do not submit a pull request.

## Additional Notes

The most efficient way to narrowly solve this problem probably involves pre-processing the data and then serving that pre-processed data, but we are not interested in a narrow solution. So, we would like you to assume that a different process will add to the data (with no assumption as to the magnitude of the additions). Your solution should be optimized for a system that could expand to billions of nodes.
